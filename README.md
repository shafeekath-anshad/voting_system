A voting system using Flask, a Python web framework, could be designed to allow users to cast their votes on various topics, polls, or elections through a web interface.
Setup and Installation: Start by setting up a Flask project and installing the necessary dependencies like Flask, SQLAlchemy (for database management), and possibly Flask-WTF (for form handling).
Database Design: Design a database schema to store information about users, candidates, and votes. For example, you might have tables for users, candidates, and a join table to link users with their votes.
User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. This could involve features like registration, login, logout, etc.
candidates: Add candidates by the authorised admin and they can be modified or deleted as per the situations.they are displayed at the time given for the users to vote.
Poll Display: Design the interface for displaying polls to users. Users should be able to see the options pf candidates, and then select their choice to vote.
Vote Handling: Implement the logic to handle user votes. Once a user selects an option and submits their vote, it should be recorded in the database.
Results Display: After a user has voted, they should be able to see the current results of the poll, including the total number of votes cast for each option.
